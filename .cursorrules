# General Project Rules
- Follow Conventional Commits for ALL commit messages.
- Types: feat, fix, chore, docs, style, refactor, perf, test.
- Use imperative mood: "add feature" instead of "added feature".
- Breaking changes must use "feat!:" or "fix!:".

# Tech Stack Guidelines
- Angular 21+, Tauri v2, pnpm.
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling.
- Ensure all tests pass (`pnpm test`) before finalizing any implementation.

# Git Workflow
- Never push directly to `main`.
- Always create a feature branch and a PR.
- The build and deploy process is automated via GitHub Actions on merge to `main`.
