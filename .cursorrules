# General Project Rules
- Follow Conventional Commits for ALL commit messages.
- Types: feat, fix, chore, docs, style, refactor, perf, test.
- Use imperative mood: "add feature" instead of "added feature".
- Breaking changes must use "feat!:" or "fix!:".

# Tech Stack Guidelines
- Angular 21+, Tauri v2, pnpm.
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling.
- Ensure all tests pass (`pnpm test`) before finalizing any implementation.

# Git Workflow
- Never push directly to `main`.
- Always create a feature branch and a PR.
- The build and deploy process is automated via GitHub Actions on merge to `main`.

# AI Agent Rules
- **Branching**: Start every task by creating a new branch (e.g., `feat/...` or `fix/...`).
- **TDD**: Apply Test-Driven Development. Write failing tests first, then implement the code.
- **Micro-Commits**: Make small, frequent, atomic commits throughout the task.
- **Commit Messages**: Use conventional commit messages.
- **Linting**: Run `pnpm lint` and `pnpm format` before finalizing any implementation.
- **Changelog**: After completing a task, automatically update `CHANGELOG.md` with a new entry (version, date, summary).
- **Versioning**: Bump the project version correctly (patch, minor, or major) in `package.json` using `npm version <type> --no-git-tag-version`. Do NOT create or push git tags locally, as this is handled by GitHub Actions on merge.
