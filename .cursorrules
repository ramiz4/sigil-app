# General Project Rules
- Follow Conventional Commits for ALL commit messages.
- Types: feat, fix, chore, docs, style, refactor, perf, test.
- Use imperative mood: "add feature" instead of "added feature".
- Breaking changes must use "feat!:" or "fix!:".

# Tech Stack Guidelines
- Angular 21+, Tauri v2, pnpm.
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling.
- Ensure all tests pass (`pnpm test`) before finalizing any implementation.

# Git Workflow
- Never push directly to `main`.
- Always create a feature branch and a PR.
- The build and deploy process is automated via GitHub Actions on merge to `main`.

# AI Agent Rules
- **Branching**: Start every task by creating a new branch (e.g., `feat/...` or `fix/...`).
- **TDD**: Apply Test-Driven Development. Write failing tests first, then implement the code.
- **Micro-Commits**: Make small, frequent, atomic commits throughout the task.
- **Versioning**: Bump the project version correctly (patch, minor, or major) based on the implementation before finishing.
