# Sigil Authenticator

**Sigil** is a modern, minimal, and secure open-source 2FA Authenticator application built with Angular and Tauri.

## Rationale
The name **Sigil** refers to an inscribed symbol believed to have magical power. In our context, it represents the cryptographic "seal" or token that grants access to your accounts.

## Features
- 🛡️ **Offline First**: No cloud sync, no tracking. Your secrets stay on your device.
- 📱 **Cross-Platform**: Runs in the browser and as a native desktop app (macOS, Windows, Linux).
- 📷 **QR Scanning**: Add accounts by scanning QR codes via webcam or importing images.
- ⚡ **Modern UI**: Dark mode support, clean aesthetics, and fluid animations.
- 📋 **Flexible**: Drag/Drop QR images, Paste `otpauth://` URLs, or Manual Entry.

## Development

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18+)
- pnpm
- Rust (for Tauri desktop build)

### Web Development
To run the web application in the browser:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```
Open `http://localhost:4200`.

### Desktop Development (Tauri)
To run the native desktop application:

```bash
pnpm tauri dev
```

### Build
Web only:
```bash
pnpm build
```

Desktop app:
```bash
pnpm tauri build
```

## Architecture
- **Frontend**: Angular 21 (Standalone Components, Signals).
- **Storage**: IndexedDB (via `idb`) for persistent local storage on both Web and Desktop.
- **Crypto**: `otpauth` library for RFC 6238 TOTP generation.
- **Scanning**: `@zxing/browser` for QR code decoding.

## Roadmap
- [ ] Encrypted Backup/Restore (JSON)
- [ ] PIN Lock on app startup
- [ ] Folder organization for accounts
- [ ] Mobile version (using Capacitor provided responsive design)
